# 1D Slab Neutron Transport using Sn Method (MATLAB)

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts to solve simplified one-dimensional (1D) slab geometry neutron transport problems using the **Discrete Ordinates Method (Sn method)**. These codes are intended for educational and research purposes to provide insight into deterministic neutron transport theory and numerical implementation.

## Features

- Implementation of the Sn method for 1D slab geometry
- Source iteration for solving the transport equation
- Scalar flux computation and visualization

## Requirements

- MATLAB (tested with R2023a and later)
- No external toolboxes required
